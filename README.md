# ASSESSING AND PREDICTING THE QUALITY OF WATER

This project shows an overview about the dataset of water portability and it compares the algorithms with others and found which algorithm performs the best accuracy when compared to others.

# ALGORITHM USED

        NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFICATION
        LOGISTIC REGRESSION
        ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK
        
# REQUIRED LIBRARIES

        import numpy 
        import pandas 
        import matplotlib.pyplot 
        import seaborn 
        import train_test_split
        import metrics
        import GaussianNB
        import LogisticRegression
        import MLPClassifier
    
# Steps

   STEP 1- You can collect the datasets from Kaggle (water_potability)
   
   STEP 2- Load the datasets that you have downloaded
   
   STEP 3- Check whether the dataset has null value. If null value occurs do the data preprocessing
   
   STEP 4- Split the dataset (79.98% in training set and 20.02% in testing set)
   
   STEP 5- Fit the naive bayes model and get the predicted values, Then perform the accuracy on testing as well as training
   
   STEP 6- Fit the logistic model and get the predicted values, Then perform the accuracy on testing as well as training
   
   STEP 7- Fit the ANN model and get the predicted values, Then perform the accuracy on testing as well as training
   
   STEP 8- Compare all the 3 algorithm and See which has the best accuracy
